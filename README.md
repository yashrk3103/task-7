4. Verified Adblock Plus permissions:
   - **Read/change all data on all websites** and **display notifications**.
   - Installed from the official Chrome Web Store.
   - No suspicious behavior observed.
5. Verified Google Docs Offline permissions:
   - Access limited to `docs.google.com` and `drive.google.com`.
   - Official extension from Google.

## 📚 Research: How Malicious Extensions Can Harm Users
- **Data Theft**: Malicious extensions can steal passwords, credit card numbers, or sensitive data.
- **Ad Injection**: They can insert unwanted ads or redirect you to malicious sites.
- **Browser Hijacking**: Change your homepage or search engine without consent.
- **Cryptojacking**: Use your computer’s CPU to mine cryptocurrency secretly.

**Best practices**:
✅ Always install extensions from official sources.  
✅ Review permissions carefully; unnecessary broad permissions should raise suspicion.  
✅ Keep extensions updated automatically.  
✅ Remove extensions you no longer use.
